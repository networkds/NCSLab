This program allows the management of the ICT infrastructure of NCSLab. 
The laboratory has different types of computers which include servers, laptops, and Raspberry Pis. The servers are at the level of
Cloud, laptops at the Edge level, and Raspberry Pis at the IoT level.
Beyond their level within the ICT infrastructure, all computers have an ID generated by the Helpdesk, RAM memory, disk storage, processing capacity (CPU), and an architecture that can be either x64 or ARM.
